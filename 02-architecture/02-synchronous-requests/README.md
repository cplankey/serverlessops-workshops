# Serverless Synchronous Requests

In this module we'll cover making synchronous requests in between Lambda functions. We'll do that by refactoring *wild-rydes-ride-fleet* *GetUnicorn* to handle direct invocation by *RequestRide* in *wild-rydes*, bypassing API Gateway.

## Goals and Objectives
**Objectives:**
* Understand how to perform synchronous requests when you may have made a web request

**Goals:**
* Refactor *wild-rydes-ride-fleet* *GetUnicorn* to be invoked directly

## Synchronous Requests

In the previous module we noted how our architecture started as a traditional web microservices architecture and how some communication between services could be refactored into an asynchronous event driven architecture which results in faster responses to the user. But not every operation fits that pattern easily.

*When you need to make synchronous requests in your serverless application, what do you do?*

In *Wild Rydes* there's a request made between *wild-rydes* and *wild-rydes-fleet* to fetch a unicorn from the fleet. For simplicity we want to keep this a synchronous request. We can continue with our current architecture if we wished.

![API Gateway Request](../../images/wild-rydes-apig-request.png)

Using API Gateway in front of a Lambda function has many benefits. For example:

* Authentication and authorization integration
  * AWS Cognito
  * Custom authorizers
* Request throttling
* AWS WAF integration for filtering malicious traffic.
* Ability to generate API documentation

While continuing with a web microservices pattern using API Gateway and Lambda is just fine in many cases, it does have its own set of drawbacks. Two of them are:

* Additional cost
  * API Gateway requests are charged independent of Lambda invocations
* Added request latency.

In this module we'll demonstrate how to bypass API Gateway and have one Lambda function invoke another directly for making a synchronous request. Instead of an HTTP endpoint providing a stable interface to trigger our code, we will trigger a function handler directly using an [AWS SDK API for Lambda function invocation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/lambda.html#Lambda.Client.invoke). Depending on your needs, this can be a useful pattern for application.

![Lambda Invoke Request](../../images/wild-rydes-lambda-invoke.png)

Which of the two patterns above is "the best"? You'll find lots of arguments in the AWS serverless community over which pattern you should use. But the simplest answer is this, *there is no answer to which pattern is "the best".* Which pattern you should use is based on the context of your needs and what you / your team / your organization values.

## Instructions

### 1. Update wild-rydes-ride-fleet

Deploy the wild-rydes-ride-fleet service. Check out the *workshop-architecture-01* branch for this workshop module and then deploy the application.

```
$ cd $WORKSHOP/wild-rydes-ride-fleet
$ git checkout -b workshop-architecture-02 origin/workshop-architecture-02
$ sls deploy -v
```

### 2. Refactor *wild-rydes-ride-fleet* *GetUnicorn* for direct invocation.

We'll refactor this service so it's possible to easily get a unicorn from the fleet by directly invoking the function. When done there will be be a new Lambda function that expects to be invoked directly using the [AWS SDK API for Lambda function invocation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/lambda.html#Lambda.Client.invoke).

_NOTE: We'll create two Lambda functions because we still need the API Gateway for the *LoadTable* Lambda function and custom resource. This way you're not forced to refactor that too._

#### Refactor code in *handlers/get_unicorn.py*

Start by renaming the python function `handler()` to `handler_apig()` to indicate this function is specifically for use with API Gateway. Next create a new handler function named `handler_invoke()` that takes an `event`, and `context` as arguments. The `handler_invoke()` function needs to do one thing, and this is return the value from the function `_get_unicorn()`

</p>
</details>

This refactoring is very easy in part because the `handler()` function previously only handled receiving the triggering event, some basic logging, calling `_get_unicorn()`, and responding to the event source. All the real work of fetching a unicorn was done in `_get_unicorn()`. If you keep handler logic responsible for event source handling and the business logic of your Lambda function separate it becomes easy to add new or support multiple event sources.

#### Add Function and SSM Parameter to *serverless.yml*
Now add a new function to the _serverless.yml_ file. Rename the _RequestUnicorn_ function to _RequestUnicornApig_ and then change the handler value to `handlers/get_unicorn.handler_apig`. After that, make a copy of the function and rename it _RequestUnicornInvoke_, change the handler value to `handlers/get_unicorn.handler_invoke`, and remove the `event` key and the keys under it.

Your _serverless.yml_ file should now have two functions which correspond to the two handlers you created in *handlers/get_unicorn.py*.

Next, create an SSM parameter named `/wild-rydes-ride-fleet/${self:provider.stage}/RequestUnicornInvokeArn` with a value of the ARN of the *RequestUnicornInvoke* Lambda function. You can use the *Fn::GetAtt* CloudFormation function to get the Arn.

_NOTE: Serverless Framework renames function resources in the template it generates by adding "LambdaFunction" onto the end of the name. You'll need to use the Fn::GetAtt with the renamed resource. eg. RequestUnicornInvoke -> RequestUnicornInvokeLambdaFunction _

Finally, deploy the updated application. Fix any errors if your deploy is not successful

### 3. Refactor *RequestRide* in *wild-rydes* to invoke *GetUnicornInvoke*
Now you will refactor the *wild-rydes* service yo bypass API gateway and invoke *GetUnicorn* from *wild-rydes-ride-fleet* directly.

#### Refactor *serverless.yml*
Start in the *serverless.yml* file. Rename `request_unicorn_url` to `request_unicorn_arn`. Then, change it's value from doing a lookup in CloudFormation, to fetcjhong the value of `wild-rydes-ride-fleet/${self:custom.stage}/RequestUnicornInvokeArn` from SSM Parameter Store.

#### Refactor *handlers/request_ride.py*

Now move to the *handlers/request_ride.py* file. Similar to what you did in *serverless.yml*, replace the `REQUEST_UNICORN_URL` variable at the top of the file with `REQUEST_UNICORN_ARN` which gets its value from the `REQUEST_UNICORN_ARN` environmental variable.

Once you've done that, create a variable named `LAMBDA_CLIENT` which gets it's value from calling `boto3.client('lambda')`. _(If you look a few lines below you'll see where `SNS_CLIENT` is created which is similar to what you should be adding.)_

Next move to the `_get_unicorn()` function. This step can be a little confusing so we'll show you the code change to make and explain it.

 def _get_pickup_location(body):
```

The function will no longer take an argument named `url` with a default value of `REQUEST_UNICORN_URL`, but instead take an argument named `arn` with a default value of `REQUEST_UNICORN_ARN`.

Next, the code no longer makes an HTTP GET request using the `requests` module. Instead it uses the `LAMBDA_CLIENT` created earlier to invoke the _GetUnicorn_ Lambda function directly. The `LAMBDA_CLIENT.invoke()` call requires a`FunctionName` argument which we pass `arn` as the value.

The `LAMBDA_CLIENT.invoke()` call returns a Python dictionary. We're interested in the value of the `Payload ` key which has the unicorn information. However the key's value is not a string, it's a file-like object. We'll read the contents of the file-like object, which is a string containing a JSON document, and convert it from binary to ascii. Finally we return that data from the function. _NOTE: We figured most people would get tripped up by having to fetch the response data by reading the contents of a file._

```

### 4. Test application

As a last step, request a ride from the Wild Rydes frontend. If a unicorn appears and you receive no errors then you have completed these steps successfully.

Q. Which would you choose and why?

<details>
<summary><strong>Possible Answer</strong></summary>
<p>
Because where making a request between our own services we can do authentication and authorization, request throttling, and malicious traffic filtering at the user facing service, *wild-rydes*. And since we don't feel we would gain additional advantages through those benefits of API Gateway on *wild-rydes-ride-fleet*, the cost and latency drawbacks make removing API Gateway appealing.
</p>
</details>

**EXTRA CREDIT:** Refactor the *LoadTable* Lambda function and custom resource in *wild-rydes-ride-fleet* so it does not need API Gateway anymore.
